# Account Contract
## Overview

The Account contract is a Solidity smart contract designed for managing accounts on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create accounts, and manage a collective balance with deposit and withdrawal functionalities. The contract includes basic security features and validations to ensure proper account management and operations.
Features

    Account Creation: Users can create an account with their Ethereum address and a name.
    Balance Management: The contract maintains a collective balance that users can deposit to and withdraw from.
    Maximum Balance Cap: A maximum balance limit is enforced to ensure the balance does not exceed a predefined limit.
    Basic Security: Includes input validation and invariants maintenance through require statements.

## Requirements

    Solidity (version 0.8.18 or later)
    Node.js and npm (for interacting with the contract using tools like Hardhat or Truffle)

## Setup and Deployment

    Install Dependencies:
        Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
        Install OpenZeppelin contracts: npm install @openzeppelin/contracts.

    Compile the Contract:
        Use a Solidity compiler or a framework like Hardhat or Truffle to compile the contract.

    Deploy the Contract:
        Deploy the contract to a local testnet or Ethereum network using a deployment script.

## Note

    The contract's deposit and withdraw functions modify an internal balance variable but do not handle actual Ether transfers. This needs to be addressed for practical use.
    The contract currently lacks individual account balance tracking and access control features.
    This is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used outside of that scope
